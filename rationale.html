<h2>The Problem Is Not Capability — It Is Traceability</h2>

<p>
Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly used to make or inform decisions that affect people, organizations, and infrastructure. These systems now approve loans, recommend medical actions, detect fraud, filter content, prioritize job applicants, and trigger automated enforcement across digital platforms.
</p>

<p>
As their influence grows, a simple question becomes unavoidable: <strong>What evidence exists that an AI system made a particular decision, under specific conditions, at a particular time?</strong>
</p>

<p>
In many deployments today, the answer is: very little.
</p>

<h2>Complex Systems Require Records</h2>

<p>
Every high-stakes system that society depends on is built on records. Finance has transaction ledgers. Medicine has patient charts. Aviation has flight data recorders. Law has case files.
</p>

<p>
These records do not make the systems perfect. They make them governable. They allow errors to be investigated, responsibility to be assigned, patterns to be identified, and regulations to be enforced.
</p>

<h2>Why Explainability Is Not Enough</h2>

<p>
Much of the discussion around AI accountability focuses on explainability. Explainability is useful, but it is not sufficient. An explanation answers why a model might behave a certain way. A record answers what actually happened in a specific case.
</p>

<p>
Without records, you cannot prove what happened, reproduce failures, or establish responsibility. A system that cannot leave a trace of its actions cannot be meaningfully held accountable.
</p>

<h2>The Case for Minimum Records</h2>

<p>
The solution is not to log everything. Storing raw prompts, internal reasoning, or personal data introduces privacy and security risks. What is needed instead is a minimum record: a small, standardized artifact that captures the essential facts of a decision without exposing sensitive data.
</p>

<h2>Accountability Requires Evidence</h2>

<p>
When no durable record exists, vendors can deny involvement, operators can blame models, and users have no proof. Minimum records change this by creating a paper trail that courts, auditors, and regulators can rely on.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
AI systems are becoming decision-making infrastructure. Infrastructure without records is unsafe. Minimum, standardized decision records are the foundation that makes powerful systems auditable, governable, and accountable over time.
