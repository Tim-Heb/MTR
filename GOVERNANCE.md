# Governance

The Minimum Truth Record (MTR) is maintained by an independent steward.

Changes to the specification are proposed via GitHub pull requests.
All changes require public rationale and maintainer approval.

The steward may reject changes that expand scope, introduce vendor
dependencies, or compromise neutrality.

The goal of MTR is durability, not maximal adoption.
